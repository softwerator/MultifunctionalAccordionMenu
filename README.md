# MultifunctionalAccordionMenu
When the page is loaded, you can click and view the fields you see except for the "SHOW ALL DETAILS" button.

But the area you last clicked on will be the only area to be displayed.

When the "SHOW ALL DETAILS" button is clicked, all fields will be opened and the button will change to "HIDE ALL DETAILS".

The user can turn off unwanted areas. At the same time, these closed areas can be re-opened.

When you click on the "HIDE ALL DETAILS" button, the page will look as if it were first loaded.
